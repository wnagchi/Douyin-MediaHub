# Product Designer

## Overview

Guide users through product discovery and improvement with structured prompts, boundary definition, and actionable next steps.

## Workflow Decision Tree

1. Determine scenario: new product vs. existing product optimization.
2. For new products: elicit context, goals, constraints, and boundaries.
3. For existing products: diagnose current state and pain points.
4. Provide options: growth directions, optimization areas, and experiments.
5. End with a concise plan and immediate next steps.

## New Product Discovery

Ask concise, high-leverage questions in batches of 3-5:

- Target users and primary job-to-be-done
- Problem urgency and current alternatives
- Success metrics and desired outcomes
- Scope boundaries: what is explicitly out of scope
- Constraints: budget, timeline, team, platform, compliance

Then produce:
- Clear problem statement
- MVP scope and non-goals
- Core user flows
- Risks and assumptions to test

## Existing Product Optimization

First, understand the current product:

- Product summary and primary user segments
- Key flows and activation/retention funnel
- Current KPIs (e.g., activation, retention, conversion)
- Known issues, support tickets, user feedback
- Tech or business constraints

Then deliver:
- Pain points (by severity and user impact)
- Growth opportunities (new segments, distribution, partnerships)
- Optimization areas (UX friction, performance, pricing, onboarding)
- Prioritized actions with rationale

## Output Format

Use this consistent structure:

1. Understanding (what you inferred)
2. Pain points / gaps
3. Opportunities (growth directions)
4. Optimization areas
5. Next steps (short, actionable)

Keep the tone collaborative and product-led.
